# Welcome to **bacpipe** (**B**io**A**coustic **C**ollection **Pipe**line)

### This repository aims to streamline the generation and evaluation of embeddings using a large variety of bioacoustic models.

The below image shows a comparison of umap embeddings based on 15 different bioacoustic models. The models are being evaluated on a bird and frog dataset (more details in [this conference paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06710)). This repository is an attempt to enable a comparison of bioacoustic models based on their embedding spaces, rather than their classification results.

# How it works

**bacpipe** requires a dataset of audio files, runs them through a series of models, and generates embeddings. These embeddings can then be used visualized and evaluated for various tasks such as clustering or classification.

By default the embeddings will be generated for the models specified in the [config.yaml](config.yaml) file. 

Currently these bioacoustic models are supported (more details below):
```yaml

available_models : [
    "animal2vec_xc",
    "animal2vec_mk",
    "audiomae",
    "aves_especies",
    "biolingual",
    "birdaves_especies",
    "birdnet",
    "avesecho_passt",
    "hbdet",
    "insect66",
    "insect459",
    "perch_bird",
    "mix2",
    "protoclr",
    "rcl_fs_bsed",
    "surfperch",
    "google_whale",
    "vggish",
  ]
```
Once the embeddings are generated, 2d reduced embeddings will be created using the dimensionality reduction model specified in the [config.yaml](config.yaml) file. 
And these dimensionality reduction models are supported:

```yaml
available_reduction_models: [
  "pca",
  "sparse_pca",
  "t_sne",
  "umap"
]
```

Furthermore, the embeddings can be evaluated using different metrics. The evaluation is done using the `evaluate.py` script, which takes the generated embeddings and computes various metrics such as clustering performance and classification performance. The evaluation results are saved in the `bacpipe/results` directory.

```yaml

available_evaluation_tasks: [
  "classification",
  "clustering"
]
```


The repository also includes a panel dashboard for visualizing the generated embeddings. To enable the dashboard, simply set the `dashboard` variable to `True` in the [settings.yaml](bacpipe/settings.yaml) file. The dashboard will automatically open in your browser (at `http://localhost:8050`) after running the `run_dashboard.py` script.

The pipeline is designed to be modular, so you can easily add or remove models as needed. The models are organized into pipelines, which are defined in the `bacpipe/embedding_generation_pipelines/feature_extractors` directory. If you want to add a different dimensionality reduction model, you do so by adding new pipeline to the `bacpipe/embedding_generation_pipelines/dimensionality_reduction` directory.

## Using annotations for evaluation

If you have annotations for your dataset, you can use them to evaluate the generated embeddings. The labels will be used to compute the clustering and classification performance of the embeddings. 

To use the annotations for evaluation, create a file called `annotations.csv` in the directory specified in the `audio_dir` variable in the [config.yaml](config.yaml) file. The file should contain the following columns:
```csv
audiofilename,start,end,label
```
Where `audiofilename` is the name of the audio file, `start` and `end` are the start and end times of the annotation in seconds, and `label` is the label of the annotation.

For reference see the [example annotations file](bacpipe/tests/test_data/annotations.csv).

If this file exists, the evaluation script will automatically use the annotations to compute the clustering and classification performance of the embeddings. The labels will also be used to color the points in the dashboard visualization showing the embeddings.


# Dashboard visualization

### bacpipe includes a dashboard visualization by default allowing you to easily explore the generated embeddings

Once embeddings are generated, they can be easily visualized using a dashboard (built using `panel`) by simply setting the `dashboard` setting in the [config.yaml](config.yaml) file to `True`.

Below you can see a gif showing the basic usage of the dashboard.

![](imgs/bacpipe_demo.gif)

The dashboard has 3 main sections:
1. Single model
2. Two models
3. All models

In the single model section, you can select a model and visualize the embeddings generated by that model. The embeddings can be colored by :
- metadata extracted from the files (date and time information, and file and parent directory) 
- the labels specified in the `annotations.csv` file
- the cluster labels generated by the clustering algorithm (kmeans)

In the dashboard sidebar you can select the model, by which to label the embeddings, whether to remove noise, and the type of classification task to show the results for. 

The noise removal is done by removing the embeddings that do not correspond to annotated sections of the audio files. This is useful if you want to focus on the annotated sections of the audio files and disregard the rest of the data. 

The visualizations can be saved as png files by clicking the save button in the bottom right corner of the plot.

__Try it out__ and (__please__) feel free to give feedback and ask questions (or suggestions for improvements) - or in case something does not work raise issues.

# Installation

### Install `uv` (recommended) or `virtualenv` or `poetry'

It is recommended to use python 3.11 for this repository, as some of the models require it. 

For speed and stability it is recommended to use `uv` instead of `virtualenv` and `pip`. To install `uv` use the following command:

`pip install uv` 

Otherwise, `pipx` will also work: 

`pipx install uv` 

You can install pipx following these instructions: https://pipx.pypa.io/latest/installation/

(for windows use `/c/Users/$USERNAME/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python311/python.exe -m pip install uv`)

If you prefer to use `virtualenv`, you can install it using the following command:

`pip install virtualenv`

(for windows use `/c/Users/$USERNAME/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python311/python.exe -m pip install virtualenv`)

If you prefer to use `poetry`, you can install it using: 

`pipx install poetry` 

### Create a virtual environment

`python3.11 -m uv venv env_bacpipe`

(for windows use `/c/Users/$USERNAME/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python311/python.exe -m uv venv env_bacpipe`)

(alternatively with `virtualenv`: `python3.11 -m virtualenv env_bacpipe`)

(alternatively for `poetry` use `poetry env use 3.11`)

(alternatively for windows with `virtualenv` use `/c/$USERNAME/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python311/python.exe -m virtualenv env_bacpipe`)

activate the environment

`source env_bacpipe/bin/activate` (for windows use `source env_bacpipe\Scripts\activate`)

### Clone the repository
`git clone https://github.com/bioacoustic-ai/bacpipe.git`

cd into the bacpipe directory (`cd bacpipe`)

### Install the dependencies once the prerequisites are satisfied.

`uv pip install -r requirements.txt` (for `pip` users omit `uv`)

If you want to use GPU, we recommend to use the pyproject approach, either with `uv` or `poetry`. 
To do that, follow: 

For `poetry`:

`poetry lock`
`poetry install`

For `uv`: 

`uv sync`


#### For Windows use the windows-specific requirements

`uv pip install -r requirements_windows.txt` 

((for `pip` users omit `uv`) windows does no support `fairseq` and will therefore not be able to run the `animal2vec` models)

If you do not have admin rights and encounter a `permission denied` error when using `pip install`, use `python -m pip install ...` instead.

### OPTIONAL: Add other model checkpoints that are not included by default.

Download the ones that are available from [here](https://github.com/bioacoustic-ai/bacpipe/tree/main/bacpipe/pipelines) and create directories corresponding to the pipeline-names and place the checkpoints within them. 

## Test the installation was successfull

By doing so you will also ensure that the directory structure for the model checkpoints will be created.

`pytest -v --disable-warnings bacpipe/tests/test_embedding_creation.py`

In case of a permission denied error, run
`python -m pytest -v --disable-warnings bacpipe/tests/test_embedding_creation.py`

If everything passes then you've successfully installed bacpipe and can now proceed to use it.

## Known installation issues

### python headers needed for animal2vec requirements to work
For non-windows users:

- for `fairseq` to install you will need python headers:
`sudo apt-get install python3.11-dev`

- once completed install fairseq:
`uv pip install fairseq==0.12.2`

- if you're not using `uv`, you'll need to ensure you have `pip` version 24.0 (`pip install pip==24.0`, omegaconf 2.0.6 has a non-standard dependency specifier PyYAML>=5.1.*. pip 24.1 will enforce this behaviour change and installation will thus fail. For Windows `env_bacpipe\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install pip==24.0`)

# Usage

## Configurations and settings

To see the capabilities of bacpipe, go ahead and run the `run_pipeline.py` script. This will run the pipeline with the default settings and configurations on a small set of test data. 

### To use bacpipe on your own data, you will need to modify the configuration files.

The only two files that need to be modified are the [config.yaml](config.yaml) and [settings.yaml](bacpipe/settings.yaml) files. The [config.yaml](config.yaml) is used for the standard configurations: 
- path to audio files
- models to run
- dimensionality reduction model
- evaluation tasks
- whether to run the dashboard or not

The [settings.yaml](bacpipe/settings.yaml) file is used for more advanced configurations and does not need to be modified unless you have specific preferences. It includes settings such as to run on a `cpu` or a `gpu` (by default `cpu`), the paths where results are saved, configurations for the evaluation tasks and more. 

Modify the [config.yaml](config.yaml) file in the root directory to specify the path to your `dataset`. Define what models to run (from the `available_models`) by specifying the strings in the `selected_models` list (copy and paste as needed, I usually just comment the model's I don't want to run). 

If you have already computed embeddings and you want to do the dimensionality reduction and evaluation for the models you have already run, you can set the `already_computed` variable to `True`. This will only select the models that have already been computed.

In either case if you have already computed embeddings with a model, **bacpipe** will skip the model and use the **already computed** embeddings (if they are still located in the same directory). Even if `overwrite` is set to `True`, **bacpipe** will not overwrite the embeddings if they already exist. 

## Running the pipeline

Once the configuration is complete, execute the run_pipeline.py file (make sure the environment is activated)
`python run_pipeline.py`

While the scripts are executed, directories will be created in the `bacpipe/results` directory. Embeddings will be saved in `bacpipe/results/YOUR_DATASET/embeddings` (see [here](results/test_data/embeddings/README.md) for more info) and if selected, reduced dimensionality embeddings will be saved in `bacpipe/evaluation/dim_reduced_embeddings` (see [here](results/test_data/dim_reduced_embeddings/README.md) for more infor) . 


## Model selection

Select the models you want to run in the [config.yaml](config.yaml) file. The models are specified in the `available_models` list. You can select the models you want to run by adding them to the `selected_models` list.

## Dimensionality reduction

Different dimensionality reduction models can be selected in the [config.yaml](config.yaml) file. The available models are specified in the section [Dimensionality reduction models](#dimensionality-reduction-models). Insert the name of the selected model in the `dim_reduction_model` variable in the [config.yaml](config.yaml) file. The default is `umap`, but you can also select `pca`, `sparse_pca` or `t_sne`.


## Dashboard

The dashboard is a panel application that allows you to visualize the generated embeddings. To enable the dashboard, set the `dashboard` variable in the [config.yaml](config.yaml) file to `True`. The dashboard will automatically open in your browser (at `http://localhost:8050`) after running the `run_dashboard.py` script.

## Evaluation

You can use `bacpipe` to evaluate the generated embeddings using different metrics. To evaluate the embeddings, you need annotations for your dataset. The annotations should be in a file called `annotations.csv` in the directory specified in the `audio_dir` variable in the [config.yaml](config.yaml) file. The file should contain the following columns:
```csv
audiofilename,start,end,label
```
Where `audiofilename` is the name of the audio file, `start` and `end` are the start and end times of the annotation in seconds, and `label` is the label of the annotation.

See the file [annotations.csv](bacpipe/tests/test_data/annotations.csv) for an example of how the annotations file should look like.

Once the annotations file is created, add either `classification` or `clustering` (or both) to the `evaluation_task` variable in the [config.yaml](config.yaml) file (use double quotes: "classification" or "clustering"). You can run the evaluation script using normal `python run_pipeline.py` command. The evaluation script will automatically use the annotations to compute the clustering and classification performance of the embeddings. The results will be saved in the `bacpipe/results/YOUR_DATASET/evaluation` directory.

<summary><b style="font-size: 2em;">Add a new model</b></summary>

To add a new model, simply add a pipeline with the name of your model. Make sure your model follows the following criteria:

- define the model specific __sampling rate__
- define the model specific input __segment length__
- define a class called "__Model__" which inherits the __ModelBaseClass__ from __bacpipe.utils__
- define the __init__, preproc, and __call__ methods so that the model can be called
- if necessary save the checkpoint in the __bacpipe.model_checkpoints__ dir with the name corresponding to the name of the model
- if you need to import code where your specific model class is defined, create a directory in __bacpipe.model_specific_utils__ corresponding to your model name "newmodel" and add all the necessary code in there

Here is an example:

```python 
import torch
from bacpipe.model_specific_utils.newmodel.module import MyClass

SAMPLE_RATE = 12345
LENGTH_IN_SAMPLES = int(10 * SAMPLE_RATE)

from ..utils import ModelBaseClass

class Model(ModelBaseClass):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(sr=SAMPLE_RATE, segment_length=LENGTH_IN_SAMPLES)
        self.model = MyClass()
        state_dict = torch.load(
            self.model_base_path + "/newmodel/checkpoint_path.pth",
            weights_only=True,
        )
        self.model.load_state_dict(state_dict)

    def preprocess(self, audio): # audio is a torch.tensor object
        # insert your preprocessing steps
        return processed_audio

    def __call__(self, x):
        # by default the model will be called with .eval() mode
        return self.model(x)

```

Most of the models are based on pytorch. For tensorflow models, see __birdnet__, __hbdet__ or __vggish__.

# Contribute

This repository is intended to be a collaborative project for people working in the field of bioacoustics. If you think there is some improvement that could be useful, please raise an **issues**, submit a **PR** or get in touch. 

There are two main intentions for this repository that should always be considered when contributing: 
      
      1. Only add new requirements if truly necessary

Given the large number of different models, there are already a lot of requirements. To ensure that the repository is stable, and installation errors are kept minimal, please only add code with new requirements if truly necessary.
      
      2. The main purpose of bacpipe is quickly generating embeddings from models
      
There should always be a baseline minimal use case, where embeddings are created from different feature extractors and everything else is an add-on.

# Known issues

Given that this repository compiles a large number of very different deep learning models with different requirements, some issues have been noted. 

Please raise issues if there are questions or bugs. 

# Citation

A lot of work has gone into creating these bioacoustic models, both by data collectors and by machine learning practitioners, please cite the authors of the respective models (all models are referenced in the table above).


This work is first described in a conference paper. If you use **bacpipe** for your research, please include the following reference:

# Newsletter and Q&A sessions

Reading from the traffic on the repository, there seems to be an interest in bacpipe. I have set up a newsletter under this link: https://buttondown.com/vskode. Once more than 30 people have signed up for the newsletter, I will schedule a Q&A session and post the link in the newsletter. Hopefully I can then help answer questions and address issues that people are running into.
